        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> A website is a collection of related web pages 
            that are connected under a single domain name (like www.ggogle.com). 
            It is stored on a web server and can be accessed through 
            the internet using a browser. </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> EXAMPLE: Google, Wikipedia - all are websites. </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;"> <b> What is a WebPage? </b> </h2>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> A WebPage is a single document on the internet. 
            It is like one page of a book-part of the full website. 
            It is written in a coding language (usually HTML) 
            and displayed through a web browser. </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> EXAMPLE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
            <br>(web page of the wikipedia website) </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;"> <b> What is HTML? </b> </h2>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> HTML stands for HyperText Markup language. 
            It is a standard language used to create and design web pages.
            <br>
            Think of HTML as the bones of a webpages-it gives structure,
            just like a skeleton gives structure to the body. 
            It is the code that is used to structure a web page and 
            its content.
            <br>
            It tells the browser what to show-headings, text, images, links etc. </p>
