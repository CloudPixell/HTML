        <h2><strong>What is a Website?</strong></h2>
        <p>A website is a collection of related web pages that are connected under a single domain name (like www.google.com). It is stored on a web server and can be accessed through the internet using a browser.</p>
        <p>EXAMPLE: Google, Wikipedia, all are websites.</p>

        <h2><strong>What is a WebPage?</strong></h2>
        <p>A WebPage is a single document on the internet. It is like one page of a book—part of the full website. It is written in a coding language (usually HTML) and displayed through a web browser.</p>
        <p>EXAMPLE: 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">Wikipedia HTML page</a><br>
            (web page of the Wikipedia website)

        <h2><strong>What is HTML?</strong></h2>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard language used to create and design web pages.</p>
        <p>Think of HTML as the bones of a webpage—it gives structure, just like a skeleton gives structure to the body. It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.</p>
        <p>It tells the browser what to show—headings, text, images, links etc.</p>
        <p>HTML = Structure</p>
        <p>CSS = Style</p>
        <p>JavaScript = Behavior</p>

        <h2><strong>Angle Brackets</strong></h2>
        <p>Angle brackets are used in HTML to define tags, which are the building blocks of a webpage.</p>
        <p>These tags tell the browser what type of content is being written and how to display it.</p>
        <p>Tags written in angle brackets help separate HTML instructions from the actual text content, allowing the browser to properly render headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>
        <p>Without <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, the browser would not recognize the tags as HTML code and wouldn't display the content correctly.</p>

        <h2><strong>What are HTML tags?</strong></h2>
        <p>They are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are special code written inside angle brackets that tell the web browser how to display content on a webpage.</p>
